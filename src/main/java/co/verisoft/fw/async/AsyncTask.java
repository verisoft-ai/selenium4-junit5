/**
 * Defines an async set of operations to be executed during the test, in an
 * async manner.<br>
 * <b>Important: tasks are executed in the same thread as the WebDriver main
 * thread.</b> It means that: <br>
 * 1. You should avoid long async operations, or use Wait Until in your async
 * operation. It will block the main thread and prevents execution. <br>
 * 2. The async code will not be performing context switching - the code will
 * run from start to finish once it is invoked. and, <br>
 * 3. The async code uses the same driver as the test. You should consider it
 * when wrapping up the async code - bring the driver back to the position where
 * it can continue the test from the point it was paused.<br>
 * <br>
 * <p>
 * Further practices to consider:<br>
 * 1. By default, the script is set to run each time a driver.findElement() is
 * invoked. You should change it to a different dispatch time. For example, to
 * change the dispatch time to 2 seconds use
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code driver.async().setDispatchInterval(2, ChronoUnit.SECONDS);}
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * 2. doTask() returns a boolean value. True, means the async task is done and
 * it will not be invoked again. False means the async task is not done (e.g
 * failed to locate an elements) and should be invoked next time as well.<br>
 * 3. Don't forget to register the observer with
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code driver.async().register(o);}
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * otherwise it will not be invoked at all. <br>
 * <br>
 *
 * <b>Example #1</b><br>
 * The following code example creates an async script to get and print the page
 * title to the STDIO, and then asks to be unregistered from further
 * executions.<br>
 * <br>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {
 *     &#64;code
 *     Observer o = new AsyncTask(driver, new SeleniumTask() {
 * 	&#64;Override
 * 	public boolean doTask() {
 * 	    String pageTitle = driver.getCurrentUrl();
 * 	    System.out.println("Time is " + LocalTime.now() + ", page url is " + pageTitle);
 * 	    return false;
 *    }
 *     });
 *     driver.async().setDispatchInterval(2, ChronoUnit.SECONDS);
 *     driver.async().register(o);
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <br>
 * <br>
 *
 * <b>Example #2</b><br>
 * The following code waits for a popup to appear on the screen, and after it
 * appears, click on dismiss and then asks to be unregistered from further
 * executions. It uses the default dispatch interval, which is 1 second:<br>
 * <br>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * Observer o = new AsyncTask(driver, new SeleniumTask() {
 *             &#64;Override
 *             public boolean doTask() {
 *                 boolean result = false;
 *
 *                 List<WebElement> elements = driver.findElements(By.id("popup-button-dismiss-locator"));
 *                 if (elements.isEmpty())
 *                     return false;
 *
 *                 try{
 *                     elements.get(0).click();
 *                     result = true;
 *                 }
 *                 catch(Throwable t)
 *                     result = false;
 *
 *                 return result;
 *             }
 *         });
 *         driver.async().register(o);
 *         }
 * </pre>
