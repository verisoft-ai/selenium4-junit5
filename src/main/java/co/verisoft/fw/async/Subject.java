/**
 * Implementation of the Observer pattern.<br>
 * This implementation is tailored for the async operation of WebDriver.
 * This interface assumes you are familiar with the observer pattern. <br>
 * To learn more about observers  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern">visit the wikipedia site</a>
 * The subject is closely coupled with the co.verisoft.selenium.framework.async.{@link Observer} class
 * In this framework, the subject is implemented by co.verisoft.selenium.framework.async.{@link AsyncListenerImp} <br>
 * The interface was designed to be triggered without any data, rather serve as a trigger for async scripts to perform
 * their async operation
